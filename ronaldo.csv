b'@ElGatoKB Name me one Madrid player in those 4 ucl wins that had more goal contributions than Ronaldo (goals or assists) go on...'
b'@ElGatoKB Nothing to do with Ronaldo though'
b'@RamiSoufi It takes two to tango though. We love having Ronaldo but money made that happen. Juve fans bitch about not winning CL and have an annual management hatred month but how would they feel if there was a salary cap like the NFL and the team was in cycles? We demand this and feed it.'
b'@_alyssawhitney russian dolls'
"b""@ImmYRedDevil Not too sure, they've had big outlays in recent years with C. Ronaldo and De Ligt, its more about getting players off the wage budget as they've also added Rabiot and Ramsey. Can't see them adding Lukaku without offloading a high earner."""
